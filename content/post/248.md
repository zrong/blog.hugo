今天收到Writely的邮件，原文如下：

>  to me More options 3:11 am (5 hours ago)

> Dear zrongzrong,

> In a few days, we will update your Writely account to use your

>
> This means you'll need to use your Google Account password when

>
> If you've forgotten your Google Account password, just go to

>
> Thanks!  
>  Google Writely Team

这意味着，今后登录Writely必须使用Google帐户的密码，就像Picasaweb、Spreadsheets、Calendar一样。

这才像Google的风格嘛。
