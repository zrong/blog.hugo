正常卸载一个带有服务的程序可以安全删除它。  
无论如何，都可以使用下面的方法删除服务：

1.运行注册表编辑器  
2.找到下面的键值：  
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services `  
3.找到服务名称并删除它。

You may wish to look at the keys and see what files the service was
using and perhaps delete them also.  
Note: You will have to reboot before the list gets updated in server
manager.  
These notes have been tested with Windows NT 4, Windows 2000 and
Windows XP
